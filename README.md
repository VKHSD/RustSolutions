# RustSolutions
Rust Solutions is a discord bot that can calculate raid materials for the basic foundations of a base, including walls, doors, and external walls.

You must replace 'TOKEN' with your discord bot token. Your bot must be able to type, read, and view the history of chats. add emoji, if you wish to add emojis to the source code.
you can do this like so, \:: inside the :: you put your emoji, for example. sulfur emoji in your discord server, you want the id, you do this \:sulfur: and send it in discord.
The end result should look something like this <:sulfur:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:> This is what you place in the discord bot if you wish for it to send emojis in its sends.

all software written by VKHSD, use is allowed but redistribution would make me sad, but there is nothing I can do to stop you. 

If there are any errors let me know.
I know of one inconsistency and that is in the .raidex command where it may sometimes give 1 less explosive ammo than needed but I compensated by allowing 5% extra
explosive ammo at the end sum total, saying "about {explo*1.05} explosive-bullet-emoji"

buy me a coff~.. I'm just kidding. I'm not that poor to ask for $2 XDDD. 

dm me on discord if you have any suggestions, my username is 'lsd2'
